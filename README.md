Kotlin Multiplatform line-by-line clean-room port of the Rust crate [`wiremock`](https://crates.io/crates/wiremock).

> **Status: scaffold — porting has not started.** This repo currently contains build infrastructure only. The upstream Rust source for the `wiremock` crate will be cloned into `tmp/` (gitignored) when porting begins.

## About

Async HTTP mocking

This port targets functional parity with the upstream Rust crate while presenting an idiomatic Kotlin Multiplatform API. Every Kotlin file is a faithful translation of an upstream Rust file and carries a `// port-lint: source <path>` header so the AST-distance tool can track provenance.

## Supported targets

- macOS arm64 / x64
- Linux x64
- Windows mingw-x64
- iOS arm64 / x64 / simulator-arm64
- JS (browser + Node.js)
- Wasm-JS (browser + Node.js)
- Android (API 24+)

## Installation

Once published:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.kotlinmania:wiremock-kotlin:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```

## Build

```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew test
```

## Porting guidelines

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) and [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for translator discipline, port-lint header convention, and Rust → Kotlin idiom mapping.
